The overwhelming majority of this $2.5 million is spent to enhance student’s experiences at Iowa State University and specifically in student organizations. Student Government also uses some of the money to provide debt assistance to student organizations, help student organizations to provide accommodations to disabled students, provide services specifically for graduate student organizations, and to depreciate current equipment to keep up with the technology standards of the future.</p><hr/><h2>Allocations to Student Organizations</h2><p>One of the most important things that the Student Government does annually is providing funding to student organizations on campus. The two major allocation cycles total over $1.6 million in organization funding which does not include the requests made to the Student Government Senate at their weekly meetings.</p><hr/><h2>Special Allocations</h2><p>The Special Allocations process is very similar to the Regular Allocations process with the simple difference that this project takes place in the fall semester and allocates money for only the upcoming spring semester. This process usually allocates $20,000 and is for organizations that missed Regular Allocations or have had unforeseen expenses arise.</p><hr/><h2>Fee Recomendations</h2><p>Each fall, the Student Government President, Finance Director, one Senator and an at-large student get together and come up with a recommendation for the amount of next year’s Student Activity Fee. These members then present this recommendation to the Special Student Fee and Tuition Committee, which takes their recommendation to the President of the University and eventually the Board of Regents.</p><hr class="shows-on-full"/></div><div class="about-right"><h2>Account Allocations</h2><p>Each year the Finance Director provides recommendations as to how to divide the student fee income across all of the Student Government accounts. This includes recommendations on how much funding to provide for human services, for executive initiatives, for discretionary spending of the Student Government Senate, and for the major Student Government allocation cycles. You can find a copy of the most recent approved account allocations here.</p><hr/><h2>Regular Allocations</h2><p>Through the Regular Allocations Process, the Student Government Finance Committee meets face to face with over 140 student organizations every spring to discuss budget requests for the next fiscal year. These budgets are mostly made up of operating and annual expenses that ensure the financial stability of an organization from year to year. All budgets are delineated by line items to ensure the proper spending of every student fee dollar. This process alone accounts for almost 85% of the student fee spending every year.</p><hr/><h2>Senate Allocations</h2><p>Each year the Student Government Senate is also allocated money to spend at their discretion. This amount can vary from $21,000-$45,000 per year. Requests are made in bill form, drafted by a Senator and are reviewed by the Finance Committee before seeing the Senate floor. In addition to discretionary spending, the Senate also has jurisdiction over the Capital Projects Account. This account is for large expenditures, those that are intended to last at least three years, and those that provide a major benefit to ISU students. The last major discretion under control of the Senate is the Events Account. Expenditures from this account are for events that are free and open to all students, and are entertaining in nature. Income to this account comes from interest earned on government investments as well as half of the previous fiscal years misspent/unencumbered monies from student organizations.</p></div><div style="clear:both" class="clear"></div></div></div></div></div></div>
