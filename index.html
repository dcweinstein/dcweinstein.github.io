                <p>Over the course of my time at ISU, I have had the opportunity to to take a range of classes that have allowed me to not only become a competent programmer, but also a well rounded human being with clear goals and ambitions. In the short term (approximately the next 12-18 months), I plan to graduate successfully in the Spring and start my career working in Omaha at BuilderTrend. My goals during this time are to successfully transition into my professional life, familiarize myself with the company and its culture, work to become and effective and well thought of employee, and to do this will creating a fulfilling personal life in Omaha. Stretching my thinking out to the 5 to 10 years that follow, my goals shift from getting settled to being a well rounded member of my community. While I do not know if I will be working for BuilderTrend in 10 years time or even living in Omaha, I do have stretch goals that exist regardless of the company I work for or the location that I live. I would like to be secure in my positions at working, having risen the ranks to be able to be in a project management role. I also hope that I continue to work on personal projects in my free time while remaining involved in many of my non-programming related hobbies.</p>
                <p>All of these goals feel very attainable to me in part because of the range of classes that I have taken while at ISU. While thinking about the courses I have taken that have shaped who I am, and who I hope to be in the future, two stand out the most. The first is a highly technical course, Computer Science 229. To put it bluntly this was the first CS class that I took at ISU that really kicked me in the ass. Up until the point of taking 229, I had had some chanlenges here and there in my CS class and would call very few of the a walk in the part, but none of the challenges I had faced up to this point were as formidable as CS229. The projects in 229 were far longer and more complex than anything I had experienced and did not fit with my procrastination heavy work ethic. At the first deadline I faced (~25% of the way into the class) I realized the night before the due date that my project was not anywhere close to being ready to turn in. I pulled an all-nighter that night and with less than 20 minutes until the dead line I had a spaghetti code filled mess of a program that only met a handful of requirements and crashed on any input that was not exactly what was expected. But it compiled, so I turned it in. Needless to say, I did not receive a high grade on this first part of the project and I was faced with a decision. I could drop the class, pick up a different elective in the Spring semester, and move on with my GPA unharmed, or I could stay in 229 and attempt to fight my way out of hole I had dug for myself. Because of some combination of arrogance, personal drive, and fear of how my parents would react to me dropping a class, I decided to stick with it. This led me to reworking my approach to my projects from the ground up. I threw out the half working project I had turned in at the first check point and began from scratch. I worked a minimum of 3 days every week on these projects, forcing myself to not only make a system that worked, but was also fault tolerant and had a (relatively) well designed codebase. Ultimately, when all was said and done, I had put more effort, time, and thought into 229 than I had in any class or project I had ever attempted, and (thankfully) I passed the class. My experience from 229 was not only rewarding, but it also taught me lesson that I have applied to nearly every class since. I would be lying if I said that I no longer procrastinate, but since taking 229 I have learned to recognize the value of working on assignment earlier, planning out what I want to accomplish and how I will accomplish it, and striving to create more accurate time estimates for how long a project will take to complete. In the end, while CS 229 was a hard fought battle for me, the lessons I learned have helped me throughout the rest of my college career and will contine to help me as I move into my professional career.</p>
                <p>The second class that I feel has shaped me the most since coming to ISU is at the polar opposite of the spectrum as CS 229. The class was in no way techincal and was not particularly challenging, but it taught me lessons and skill that have improved who I am as a student, a professional, and as a person all the same. The class was Community Leadership and Public Service 322 and it is one of the main requirments for completing a certificate in leadership studies. The class focused on reading about a wide range of leadership theories, practicing leadership techniques, and talking with leaders in our community and in our personal life to gain insight on what it takes to be an effective leader. This was a far cry for the hard sciences and technical class that had primarily filled up my schedule. This was ideal because it allowed me to focus on improving skills that I had rarely put much thought into. One of the most affecting parts of this class for me was an assignment where we were required interview a leader we knew and respected about his or her own leadership style and perspective on leadership. We repeated this assignment 3 or 4 times throughout the sememester talking to different leaders each time, but the interview I found most insightful and the one that has stuck with me the most was the interview I had with my then boss Melinda. Melinda was in an interesting situation, she was in charge of over a dozen engineers in the company, all of whom worked remotely from across the country. She also had no experience as an engineer and instead had been in a variety of management and business roles throughout her career. I was initially apprehensive about this interview, not only because it is always ackward to be interviewing your boss, but also because I was afraid that much of the leadership challenges Melinda faced would be specific to her relatively irregular position. Luckily though, I found that this was not the case at all and it lead me to realize that how universal leadership techniques really were. With this insight, I began to see how even though I was not in specific leadership role in any of my classes or extracurriculars, I could still impliment many of the leadership consepts and styles I had been learning in 322. Since this class and my interview with Melinda, I have been able to become a more effective leader when I am placed in leadership positions, as well as improving my ability to lead others and work with others when not in a leader role. I intend to apply these same skills as I move forward into my career.</p>
