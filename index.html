					<h3 class="block-header">Career Objective</h3>
					<p>Upon graduation from Iowa State with my bachelors in Software Engineering, I will begin my career by working as a Junior .NET developer at BuilderTrend in Omaha, NE. While there I hope to apply much of what I have learned while at Iowa State. This is not just limited to what I have learned in terms of programming strategies and techniques, but also the skills and knowledge I have gained in terms of leadership and interpersonal communications. I hope to continue to learn once out of school and continue to challenge myself to become a better developer and a better person.</p>

					<h3 class="block-header">Cumulative Reflection</h3>
					<p>Looking back at my time here at Iowa State, it is clear to me that I have had exceptional changes, not just in the knowledge and skills that I have, but also how I have grown and matured as a person.</p>
					<p>Right off the bat, it is obvious that my technical skills and knowledge have increased at an exceptional rate during my time here. I came into college loving computers, but having next to no experience programming. While in college, I have been able to gain experience in a wide range of programming languages and related technologies. My experience learning these new skills has also taught me a lot in terms of how to pick up and learn technical skills. I have no doubt that when I enter my professional life I will not only have the ability, but also the drive and knowledge of how to continue broadening my skillset and becoming a more well rounded programmer.</p>
					<p>Technical skills are far from everything I have learned while here at Iowa State. I have also had a number of fantastic opportunities to further my skills and abilities as a teammate and leader. While here I have been able to work on dozens of team projects ranging for ones that last a few days or weeks to projects that take whole semesters to accomplish. These projects have introduced me to many new challenges and have given me the ability to work with an incredibly diverse set of teammates. I have faced challeges time and again in planning, collaborating, and leadership and each challege has helped me grow and mature into a person fully capable of facing the professional world in an effective way.</p>
					<p>But classes, projects, and internships are not the only place where I have had the opportunity to grow while at Iowa State, the extracuricular groups and clubs I have been involved in have also helped to shape who I am and how I have grown as an individual. During my time here, I have worked and been involved in a number of groups that have allowed me to meet new people and have new, valuable experiences. Most notably, I have worked extensively with the Iowa State Honors Program, as well as the ISU Student Government. These groups have allowed me meet new people, discover more of what ISU has to offer, and helped me expand my leadership and communication skills.</p>
					<p>In the end, my time here at ISU has been a time of has allowed me to grow and mature as an engineer as well as a person. I am confident that my time and experiences here will allow me to be a successful developer and person as I move into the next stage of my career.

					<h3 class="block-header">Education Reflection</h3>
					<p>Over the course of my time at ISU, I have had the opportunity to to take a range of classes that have allowed me to not only become a competent programmer, but also a well rounded human being with clear goals and ambitions. In the short term (approximately the next 12-18 months), I plan to graduate successfully in the Spring and start my career working in Omaha at BuilderTrend. My goals during this time are to successfully transition into my professional life, familiarize myself with the company and its culture, work to become and effective and well thought of employee, and to do this will creating a fulfilling personal life in Omaha. Stretching my thinking out to the 5 to 10 years that follow, my goals shift from getting settled to being a well rounded member of my community. While I do not know if I will be working for BuilderTrend in 10 years time or even living in Omaha, I do have stretch goals that exist regardless of the company I work for or the location that I live. I would like to be secure in my positions at working, having risen the ranks to be able to be in a project management role. I also hope that I continue to work on personal projects in my free time while remaining involved in many of my non-programming related hobbies.</p>
					<p>All of these goals feel very attainable to me in part because of the range of classes that I have taken while at ISU. While thinking about the courses I have taken that have shaped who I am, and who I hope to be in the future, two stand out the most. The first is a highly technical course, Computer Science 229. To put it bluntly this was the first CS class that I took at ISU that really kicked me in the ass. Up until the point of taking 229, I had had some chanlenges here and there in my CS class and would call very few of the a walk in the part, but none of the challenges I had faced up to this point were as formidable as CS229. The projects in 229 were far longer and more complex than anything I had experienced and did not fit with my procrastination heavy work ethic. At the first deadline I faced (~25% of the way into the class) I realized the night before the due date that my project was not anywhere close to being ready to turn in. I pulled an all-nighter that night and with less than 20 minutes until the dead line I had a spaghetti code filled mess of a program that only met a handful of requirements and crashed on any input that was not exactly what was expected. But it compiled, so I turned it in. Needless to say, I did not receive a high grade on this first part of the project and I was faced with a decision. I could drop the class, pick up a different elective in the Spring semester, and move on with my GPA unharmed, or I could stay in 229 and attempt to fight my way out of hole I had dug for myself. Because of some combination of arrogance, personal drive, and fear of how my parents would react to me dropping a class, I decided to stick with it. This led me to reworking my approach to my projects from the ground up. I threw out the half working project I had turned in at the first check point and began from scratch. I worked a minimum of 3 days every week on these projects, forcing myself to not only make a system that worked, but was also fault tolerant and had a (relatively) well designed codebase. Ultimately, when all was said and done, I had put more effort, time, and thought into 229 than I had in any class or project I had ever attempted, and (thankfully) I passed the class. My experience from 229 was not only rewarding, but it also taught me lesson that I have applied to nearly every class since. I would be lying if I said that I no longer procrastinate, but since taking 229 I have learned to recognize the value of working on assignment earlier, planning out what I want to accomplish and how I will accomplish it, and striving to create more accurate time estimates for how long a project will take to complete. In the end, while CS 229 was a hard fought battle for me, the lessons I learned have helped me throughout the rest of my college career and will contine to help me as I move into my professional career.</p>
					<p>The second class that I feel has shaped me the most since coming to ISU is at the polar opposite of the spectrum as CS 229. The class was in no way techincal and was not particularly challenging, but it taught me lessons and skill that have improved who I am as a student, a professional, and as a person all the same. The class was Community Leadership and Public Service 322 and it is one of the main requirments for completing a certificate in leadership studies. The class focused on reading about a wide range of leadership theories, practicing leadership techniques, and talking with leaders in our community and in our personal life to gain insight on what it takes to be an effective leader. This was a far cry for the hard sciences and technical class that had primarily filled up my schedule. This was ideal because it allowed me to focus on improving skills that I had rarely put much thought into. One of the most affecting parts of this class for me was an assignment where we were required interview a leader we knew and respected about his or her own leadership style and perspective on leadership. We repeated this assignment 3 or 4 times throughout the sememester talking to different leaders each time, but the interview I found most insightful and the one that has stuck with me the most was the interview I had with my then boss Melinda. Melinda was in an interesting situation, she was in charge of over a dozen engineers in the company, all of whom worked remotely from across the country. She also had no experience as an engineer and instead had been in a variety of management and business roles throughout her career. I was initially apprehensive about this interview, not only because it is always ackward to be interviewing your boss, but also because I was afraid that much of the leadership challenges Melinda faced would be specific to her relatively irregular position. Luckily though, I found that this was not the case at all and it lead me to realize that how universal leadership techniques really were. With this insight, I began to see how even though I was not in specific leadership role in any of my classes or extracurriculars, I could still impliment many of the leadership consepts and styles I had been learning in 322. Since this class and my interview with Melinda, I have been able to become a more effective leader when I am placed in leadership positions, as well as improving my ability to lead others and work with others when not in a leader role. I intend to apply these same skills as I move forward into my career.</p>

				<h4 class="job-title">Software Intern - Cerner Corporation</h4>
				<div class="job-desc">
					<p>During the summer of 2016 I worked as a software intern at Cerner Corporation in Kansas City, MO. While there I worked primarily as a Javascript developer. I was given the task of creating a compenent for one of Cerner's physician's tools. The component was ment to allow physicians to better handle all of the notes they take for individual patients. I had worked significantly with javascript on personal and school projects before starting at Cerner so there was little learning curve there, however Cerner's development and testing environments and design process turned out to have a significant learning curve. I was given a high amount of autonomy on this project, which meant that I was left to spend a lot of time reading through documentation and reaching out to members of my team in order to develope my code in a way the fit Cerner's guidlines. In the end, I was able to learn a lot, not just about how to use the tools and follow the process Cerner had laid out for me, but also how to be more effective at reading and understanding technical documentation and how and when to reach out to others for help. On my final day at Cerner, with all of the development and internal testing completed for my component, we were able to get the component live and in the production environments of Cerners testing clients.</p>

				<h4 class="job-title">Client Services Tech - IT Synergistics</h4>
				<div class="job-desc">
					<p>My time at IT Synergistics (ITSy for short) was far different than the time I spent at Cerner. I worked for ITSy for 2 years starting in the summer of 2014. ITSy is a small medical software company (~20 employees) based out of Mississipppi. Their main products are two software solutions for blood centers. While working for ITSy I worked primarily out of my home. Being as ITSy is a very small company I was able to wear a lot of hats during my time there. While I was hired on the primarily work in client services, addressing technical problems and investigating bugs, I wound up working in many different and constantly changing roles during my time with the company. I was able to gain experience doing java and javascript development, database management, and did significant work designing and executing tests for new software releases. ITSy was my first job in a technical field and I was fairly inexperienced when I came on so there was a lot to learn not just about how to effectively develope and release a software product, but also how to interact and work with people in a professional environment (especially since I was working remotely). By the end of my time with ITSy I was able to gain skills and experience in nearly every part of software development.</p>
